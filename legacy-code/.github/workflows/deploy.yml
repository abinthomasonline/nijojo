          # `github.ref` would be `refs/heads/develop`. If the PR branch is `main` and the base branch
          # is also `main`, `github.head_ref` would be `main` and `github.ref` would be `refs/heads/main`.
          # If the `github.head_ref` is not available (e.g. if the workflow is triggered on a push to a branch),
          # the `github.ref` is used. `github.ref` is always available and is set to the branch or tag ref
          # that triggered the workflow.
