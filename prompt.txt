I want you to help me architect and scaffold a production-ready website using Astro.

Project Overview

We are building a personal brand + business hub website for Nijo Johny.

Domain: nijojo.com

Deployment target: GitHub Pages (static site)

Primary goal: Lead generation

Secondary goal: Strong SEO

Framework: Astro (latest stable version)

Output: Clean, fresh implementation (do not reuse legacy code directly)

This will be a multilingual website supporting:

English (default)

Malayalam

Use best practices for:

SEO (meta tags, OpenGraph, sitemap, robots.txt, semantic HTML)

Performance (Astro static build optimizations)

Accessibility

Clean component architecture

Easy future extensibility

Site Structure
1. Home Page (/)

This is the main personal landing page for Nijo Johny.

It must include:

Professional photo (placeholder for now)

Short professional bio

Contact section:

Phone

Email

WhatsApp (click-to-chat link)

Links to 3 businesses:

/emithram

/universal-tax

/insurance

The homepage should clearly position him as the owner of the three businesses and encourage contact.

2. Business Subroutes

Each business should be available as:

nijojo.com/emithram

nijojo.com/universal-tax

nijojo.com/insurance

Each business should follow a modular, configurable layout system because:

Some sections are optional

More sections may be added in the future

Design a reusable BusinessLayout system with configurable sections.

Business Sections (Required Structure)

Each business may include the following sections:

1. Home / Landing Section

What the business is about

CTA buttons:

WhatsApp

Phone

2. Facebook Page Embed (Optional)

Required only for emithram

Should be easily toggleable via config

3. Services Section

Card-based layout

Initially show limited services

“View More” / Expand button to reveal all services

Each service should link to:

/business-name/services/service-slug

Create a scalable structure for service pages.

4. Contact Section

Must include:

Google Maps embed

Email

Phone

Address

Legacy Code Reference

There is an existing website for emithram located at:

/legacy-code

You may:

Refer to it only for content and feature ideas

Extract structure, service lists, etc.

You MUST NOT:

Copy-paste code from it

Assume it works in Astro

We want a clean, modern rebuild.

Technical Requirements

Use Astro with:

File-based routing

Layout components

Shared components for:

CTA buttons

Service cards

Contact block

Section wrapper

Content-driven configuration (preferably JSON or TypeScript config files per business)

The architecture must:

Allow enabling/disabling sections per business via config

Allow easy addition of new sections in future

Allow adding new businesses easily

Support multilingual content cleanly (no messy duplication)

Implement i18n properly:

English as default

Malayalam translations

URL-based language handling preferred (e.g. /ml/...)

SEO Requirements

Implement:

Per-page meta title & description

OpenGraph tags

Structured data (JSON-LD for local business if relevant)

Sitemap generation

Clean semantic HTML

Proper heading hierarchy

Deliverables

Folder structure

High-level architecture explanation

Component breakdown

Example config for at least one business

i18n implementation strategy

Sample code for:

Layout

Business page

Service card

Config-driven section rendering

Instructions for deploying to GitHub Pages

Design this as a production-grade foundation that can scale cleanly.

Do NOT oversimplify. Think like a senior frontend architect.
